          From childhood, we have heard that trees are our best friend but in
          practical life, we didnâ€™t see anyone who treats trees as their
          friends. Although they are the most valuable life source on the earth.
          They benefit every life form in a direct or indirect way. And the
          earth is connected to them to maintain a natural balance. In this
          essay on save trees, we are discussing the reason why our friends need
          saving.

          They nourish us and protect us in many ways. Also, they keep our
          environment green and clean. So, it becomes our responsibility to
          repay them for the things they do for us by saving them. Besides,
          large trees are more beneficial than small ones because they capture
          more carbon, capture more water, combat the heat, filter greenhouse
          gases, gives shelter from heat and sunlight, etc. So, it can be said
          that we depend on them more rather than they on us.
