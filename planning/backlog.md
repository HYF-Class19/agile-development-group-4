# Backlog

The project backlog represents a collection of the various needs of a
user/customer. These needs are then transformed into a prioritized list of work
for the development team to work through.

For this project, three priority levels were distinguished i.e.,
**_Must-Haves_**, **_Should-Haves_** and, **_Could-Haves_** as further discussed
below.

## Must-Haves

are necessary for basic usability:

### Logo

- [ ] As an activist I can find the logo of the page

> There is a suitable logo with correct image with the main name of the page.

### Title of the page

- [ ] As an activist I can find the title of the page

> There's is a clear title centrally positioned in the landing page

### Main content

- [ ] As an activist I can easily tell what the page is all about

> the story. The website also captures a green theme which gives away the
> message

- [ ] As an activist I can easily find the main content of the website

> There is a clear differentiation between the header and nav, main content, and
> footer sections

## Should-Haves

will complete the user experience, but are not necessary:

### Main information

- [ ] As an activist I can find appropriate information about trees which is
      relevant and backed by resources in literature

> The main content provides information about trees as well as links to further
> resources available online

- [ ] As an activist I can easily read and visually appreciate the contents of
      the website

> The styling of the website is such that it is visually appealing with nicely
> spaced out content

### Navigation bar

- [ ] As an activist I can navigate through the different content elements

> There's is a navigation bar with relevant links to different sections of the
> website

### Media links

- [ ] As an activist I can click on the video link and it will show me the
      necessary video about the content.

> There is a media link in order to convey more information about the content.

## Could-Haves

would be really cool to add animation if there's time:

### Donation button

- [ ] As an activist I can make a donation in support of All About Trees

> The website features a **Donate** button allowing users to make a donation or
> pledge

- [ ] As an activist I can subscribe to receive more information/news concerning
      all about trees

### Subscription button

- [ ] As an activist I can subscribe to receive more information/news concerning
      all about trees

> The website features a **Subscribe** option where users are can input their
> _name_ and _email address_ to receive a monthly Newsletter
