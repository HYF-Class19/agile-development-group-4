# Backlog

The project backlog represents a collection of the various needs of a
user/customer. These needs are then transformed into a prioritized list of work
for the development team to work through.

For this project, three priority levels were distinguished i.e.,
**_Must-Haves_**, **_Should-Haves_** and, **_Could-Haves_** as further discussed
below.

## Must-Haves

are necessary for basic usability:

- [ ] As a plant enthusiast I can find the title of the page

> There's is a clear title centrally positioned in the landing page

- [ ] As a plant enthusiast I can easily tell what the page is all about

> The title is short and well descriptive with some tree images/icons that build
> to the story

- [ ] As a general user I can easily find the main content of the website

> There is a clear differentiation between the header, main content, and footer
> sections

## Should-Haves

will complete the user experience, but are not necessary:

- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I
  achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of
    consequences should occur]
  - ...
- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I
  achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of
    consequences should occur]
  - ...
- ...

## Could-Haves

would be really cool ... if there's time:

- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I
  achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of
    consequences should occur]
  - ...
- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I
  achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of
    consequences should occur]
  - ...
- ...
