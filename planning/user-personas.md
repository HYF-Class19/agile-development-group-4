# User Personas

**The project objective** : Activists should make people aware that trees are
very important and also teach them why trees are important for us. Trees and
saving the planet is the motto we should all live by. Let’s leave behind a green
planet for the next generation.

## Activists

- **Bio**: The knowleges about how valuable trees are for our survival and all
  the other living beings on this planet.
- **Needs/Goals**: Importance of trees, getting more knowledge about tree.
- **Frustrations**: Exsplain global problems like climate change because of
  global warming, an increase in floods, extinction of several species, etc. are
  the result of deforestation and an increase in pollution.
- **Scenario 1**: The activists wants to give short speech on Save Trees and
  Save Planet Earth.

## Researcher

- **Bio**: Robin Chandon, a research professor of tropical forest restoration at
  University

- **Needs/Goals**: Today, as the world searches for solutions to global climate
  change, tree planting has become more popular than ever. It’s a simple and
  appealing response to an overwhelming, existential crisis, and it makes for
  easy messaging: anyone can go out and plant a tree to help restore balance to
  Earth’s climate. But for many large-scale tree-planting initiatives, the focus
  is on the number of new trees that end up in the ground, not on planting the
  right trees in the right places or caring for them after planting to ensure
  they survive.

- **Frustrations**: Robin has done a lot of research on reforestation and plant
  trees properly. But he needs a review for his research works and feedback from
  society and other people, researchers who also participates in the ideology of
  saving the planet through the process of reforestation.

- **Scenario 1**: He should start reforestation as soon as possible with the
  help of people who are also interested and really care about the future of our
  planet.
