# Retrospective

For a project of re-creating a webpage, we were assigned as a group to learn how
to work together and help each other accomplish or desired goals.

## Stop Doing

- Sending pull requests without updating the local branch.
- Pushing multiple files to github instead of the particular file needed.

## Continue Doing

- Constant communication via text on slack.
- Asking help from each other when we have difficulties.

## Start Doing

- Naming the branches according to what we are doing and not our names.
- Running the lint:css and validate:HTML commands since we are using "lint:css"
  and "validate:HTML" in this project.

## Lessons Learned

- Realistic planning helps in a better group performance.
- Effective communication and feedback from colleagues builds a good
  team-spirit.
- Working with CSS and HTML all together and as a group.
- Resolving conflicts when pushing to github.
